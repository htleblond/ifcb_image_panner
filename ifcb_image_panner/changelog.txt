1.02a (June 13th, 2025)
- process_image will now output multiple images by "hopping" (default value is 0.8 times desired_size) from the initial crop found the previous way. Any crop whose standard deviation of the pixel values passes a certain threshold (default is 20) and has a dimension greater than desired_size times a specified scalar (default is 0.35) will be output. This includes corners and edges.
- The "best" pan is determined by which image has the highest standard deviation of pixel values, as opposed to the mean of the absolute values.
- Added option to only output the "best" crop.
- Added option to disable print statements.
- Default desired_size changed to 299 (for Inception models).
- Output images now have an extra ID number in their file names, and also include a tag describing which piece of the original image they came from.
- Improved time complexity for the padding algorithm.

1.01a (June 9th, 2025)
- Initial release.
